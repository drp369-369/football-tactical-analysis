# GenAI Tactical Match Explainer

This project demonstrates how generative artificial intelligence can be used
to translate football analytics metrics into clear, actionable tactical insights
for coaching and performance staff.

## Objective
To bridge the gap between complex football data analysis and tactical
decision-making by using language models as an interpretation layer.

## How It Works
1. Analytical metrics describing team behavior are provided as structured input.
2. A tactical prompt defines the analytical and communication context.
3. A language model generates a concise, coach-ready tactical report.

## Example Use Cases
- Match reporting for coaching staff
- Tactical pattern explanation
- Decision-making support in professional football environments

## Relevance
This project aligns with modern football analytics workflows that emphasize
interpretability, context, and actionable knowledge generation.
